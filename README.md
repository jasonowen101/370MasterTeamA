Project Title: Agile Checkers AI Development Competition

Course: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

Objective: In this agile coding project, you will organize into two development teams to create independent components of a Checkers AI. Each team will build their AI agent, and at the end of the project, these two teams will compete against each other to determine the superior Checkers AI.

Week 4 - Sprint Planning:
   - The class will form two development teams, each being broken into sub teams consisting of 1-4 students.
   - Choose team names.
   - Plan the development sprints and distribute tasks.

Week 5 - Game Logic Component:
   - Team 1: Implement the game board, rules, and logic for Checkers.
   - Team 2: Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the Checkers game.

Week 6 - AI Core Component:
   - Team 1: Design and implement the core AI algorithms (minimax, alpha-beta pruning, or other suitable techniques).
   - Team 2: Develop a move validation system to ensure AI and player moves are valid.

Week 7-8 - AI Strategy Component:
   - Team 1: Develop advanced strategies for the AI (e.g., capturing opponents' pieces, evaluating board positions).
   - Team 2: Implement an AI opponent strategy for challenging gameplay.

Week 9-10 - Testing and Optimization:
   - Team 1: Test the AI component against human players and fine-tune its performance.
   - Team 2: Optimize the GUI for user-friendliness and aesthetics.

Week 11 - Competition Preparation:
   - Each team ensures that their AI component is integrated seamlessly with the game logic and GUI.
   - Conduct internal AI vs. AI matches to assess readiness.

Week 12 - AI Showdown:
   - Organize the competition between the two teams' Checkers AI.
   - Teams compete in a series of matches to determine the superior AI.

Week 13 - Documentation and Presentation:
   - Both teams prepare documentation, including game rules, AI algorithms, and strategies.
   - Each team gives a presentation on their Checkers AI project to the class.

Grading Criteria:
   - AI Performance in the Competition (40%)
   - Code Quality and Modularity (20%)
   - Documentation and Presentation (20%)
   - Collaboration within the Team (10%)
   - Adherence to Agile Principles (10%)

Note: This agile coding project divides the development tasks into independent components to foster parallel development. At the end of the project, the two development teams will compete to determine the better Checkers AI. Encourage ethical considerations, fair play, and sportsmanship during the competition.
